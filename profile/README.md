## Autonomous Times

Differing opinions are invaluable expressions of human thought. Yet, the platforms facilitating their dissemination must transcend bias and reliance on singular entities to foster true collaboration and autonomy. In essence, they should embody a decentralized ethos.

However, there's a fascinating paradox here: neutral infrastructure actually empowers authors with greater ownership and agency. Within collaborative publishing, participants actively shape content in a shared environment, making decisions collectively.

This leads me to a project that continually captivates my attention: a holistic approach to collaborative writing and publishing.

Here's our exploration: developing foundational tools for sharing Markdown texts that possess the following attributes:

Version control for tracking changes over time.
Encryption to safeguard sensitive content.
Collaboration capabilities, enabling multiple contributors.
Compatibility with various editing platforms.
Ownership recorded on a blockchain ledger.
Author-publisher agreements stored on-chain, preserving shared ownership without transfer.
Flexibility for temporary or revocable agreements between parties.
Publishers structured as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on the blockchain.
HTML generation and deletion managed by a neutral static site generator, governed by on-chain agreements.
Web hosting facilitated through a marketplace of computing providers.
In essence, we're building a robust ecosystem where collaborative writing and publishing thrive, empowered by decentralized principles and cutting-edge technology.
